# Gc-System
According to research The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of solid waste annually and Pakistan generates approximately 49.6 million tons of solid waste in year, which has been increasing more than 2.4 percent annually. All major cities face enormous challenges on how to manage urban waste and we must know that our country is the 3rd most polluted country in the world because we lacks waste management infrastructure, creating serious environmental problems. Unfortunately, there is no proper mechanism exists in our country for garbage collection. We have garbage at every corner of our streets which causes air pollution and different diseases. So, so we made a GC system for Administration of City to collect garbage from the door step of people. Vehicles, drivers and Information of resident can be store and managed. Vehicles will collect garbage on assigned schedule which will facilitate the whole city. People just need to subscribe for services and put their garbage at out side the house on a specific time. We also have strong mechanism to collect bill from user as per as the ratio of their Usage. This system is not only to collect the garbage but it also have a infrastructure to dispose the garbage at proper location and recycler waste will use to make different products like plastic, paper, mirror and other things. Our goal is to make our cities neat and clean. Neat and clean environment will make healthy life of our nation. Thanks for your attention.
